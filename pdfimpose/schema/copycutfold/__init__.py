"""Print pages, to be cut and folded, and eventually bound, to produce multiple books.

You want to print and bind several copies of a tiny A7 book.  Those books are made with A6 sheets (when you open the book, you get two A7 pages side-by-side, which is A6).  Since you can fit four A6 pages on an A4 page, this means that you can print four books at once.

To use this schema (without option --group):

- print your imposed file, two-sided;
- cut the stack of paper, to get several stacks (four in the example above);
- fold (once) and bind each stack of paper you got, separately;
- voilà! You now have several copies of your book.

With option --group=3 (for instance), repeat the step above for every group of three sheets. You get several signatures, that you have to bind together to get a proper book.
